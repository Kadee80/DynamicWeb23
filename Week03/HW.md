### Homework / In Class Continued

Current Project:
- Hide/Show [+] and [-] buttons based on current count. For example if we have 5 stars, hide the [+] button since we cannot add any more
- Update the styling so that the hearts and button locations do not jump as things hide/show
- Add a header and wrapper element to the page to make it look more like an app or webpage

Other:
- Make sure you are up to date with your assignments and understand class notes and exercises up until this point before next week. Next week we will play a little more with State before diving in to Redux!

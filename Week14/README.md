# Final Project Presentations

Today you will be presenting your final projects in class! We will start with volunteers. After that, I will call out who will present until we get to the end. Do not worry if you're project is not fully complete. Present where you are at the moment and point out any troubles you had along the way.

## A note about deadlines and grading

As long as you present your progress today your final is considered on time! You will have an extra week to work on any loose ends before I review the code itself.

## Week 15?

We are required to have a 15 week class for the graduate program. Since ITP usually operates on a 14 week schedule, and undergraduates have a final exam week 15, we will have an _optional_ Week 15 online class next week. Notes about this class and a link to the online class meeting can be found in the Week15 folder of our class repo.

We will re-visit our reusable table component and look at how we can make a `SortableTable` wrapper to make some columns sortable. Again, this class will be held online as many students may have already booked flights home for the holidays.

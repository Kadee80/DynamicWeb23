### HOMEWORK:

[Read Through This Git Tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

- Add your github repo link to the [class roster google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjZDz15ms0aIqRK15BPQZGZ6ekBJ2GLUwkXSKE_0i34/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make sure you have all software set up for next class.

- Make a new folder in your HW repo called Week_1. Create an HTML file containing a recipe card (CSS styling is optional). Take a look at the Notes and Examples in `/Resources/` for HTML and CSS basics. The recipe card should contain:
  - A photo of the completed dish (or placeholder img)
  - Brief description of the recipe
  - List of ingredients
  - List of instructions

We will be converting this from HTML to JSX next week.

Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.

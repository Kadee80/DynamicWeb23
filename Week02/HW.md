# HW - Due Monday, Week 3

1. Take a look at a fairly complicated recipe website. Using a tool of your choice, analyze/diagram what their site map and information architecture looks like. Obviously, I donâ€™t expect you to go down to the individual recipe level, but be sure to show how the site you choose breaks down their recipes into categories and at least 1 sub-category.

2. Read [this article](http://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/five-important-considerations-for-wireframing/?utm_source=weekly_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=aug17newsletter) on wireframing. Post a brief reaction on your blog. If your blog is not set up yet, push a .txt file to your week2 hw folder on your class repository.

3. Using the recipe you uploaded last week _(or a new one)_ wireframe your desired layout for a single recipe page on your hypothetical recipe site. Think - rows, columns, sidebars, headers, footers etc. Be sure to mark up each block of content in your wireframe with a few HTML tags for practice.

4. Mark up your recipe in HTML semantically based on your wireframe. Bonus points for applying some basic font and color styles.

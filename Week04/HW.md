# HW Due Week05:

1. Next week you will be presenting you ideas for a midterm project that utilizes React and State. This can be a group project if you prefer! Next week come prepared to quickly present a project idea that will be due Week07.

Your presentation should include:

- An elevator pitch decscribing what you'd like to build. This could be a game, or a styled webpage with some React interactivity.
- List the concepts we have covered already you will utilize in your project
- List the known unknowns you project presents

2. If you are scatching your head for an idea, take a look at the React docs tutuorial on a "seemingly simple" [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

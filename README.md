## Course Pre-requisites

Basic computer knowledge. Basic familiarity with any programming/scripting language is preferred. Moderate familiarity with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

## Course Description

In this course, students focus on client-side programming. Assignments are arranged in sequence to enable the production of a webpage of professional quality in design and production. This studio stresses interactivity, usability, and the quality and appropriateness of look and feel. This course will utilize industry standard design and build patterns and type checking.

In this course we will dive into SPAs (single page web applications) with the latest React and Redux technology. After refreshing a few front end should knows and good to knows, we will build simple games using React + JSX, keep track of the progress and score via local State and Redux Store and then style them with CSS Modules and Variables. Then we will progress to a semester long project where students will learn the concepts of reusable components, atomic CSS, and create a living Style Guide using Styleguidist as we build out a custom website using React, Redux, and Webpack. Class speed permitting we may also delve into testing with our component library.

### Program Learning Objectives

**Students will:**

- develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.

- develop technical skills to realize their ideas.

- develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

- gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

- develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### Course Objectives

- Refresh and expand knowledge of fundamental front end web development languages such as HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript
- Learn how to create and build upon a React project with Webpack.
- Track user interaction with React local state and/or Redux
- Build and maintain a component library with Styleguidist and CSS variables.
- Implement type checking via TypeCheck.

### Course Structure

Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, review, and in class exercises/presentations. Homework will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a repository with README.md files for documentation.

#### Readings

There is no required textbook for this course, however students will be required to review the upcoming class notes located in the class repository.

#### Laptop Usage During Class

I love having WiFi available and I think it is a valuable tool for use in the classroom. Unfortunately, it can very easily be a distraction as well. We are going to be exploring a variety of models for live interaction online and therefore laptops will prove very useful. We should though be courteous to one another and when we have outside guests, during discussion or student presentations laptops use should be curtailed.

## Grading

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

**Regular Assignments 20%**

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class.

**Mid-Term Project 25%**

The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge of HTML and CSS elements.

**Participation and Attendance 25%**

Attendance is _mandatory_. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade. This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 25% of your overall grade.

**PLEASE NOTE: 3 unexcused absences will result in your grade dropping 5%**

**Final Project 25%**

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks.

**Documentation**

## Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

### A. Excellent (90-100)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

### C. Satisfactory (70-79)

Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)

Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)

Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.

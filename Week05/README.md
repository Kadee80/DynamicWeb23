## Week05 Midterm Project Proposals

Today we will start class with your project proposals. Remember these individual or group projects will be due _Week07_. I will be calling out names for our presentation order.

## Intro to CSS Variables and Type Checking with Flow

We will be revisiting our recipe cards project today for a breif overview of CSS variables and Flow.

Create a new `create-react-app` project and copy the `src-start/` folder into the project. Make sure you re-name `src-start/` to `src`! Start your dev server to make sure everything is working.

```bash
cd project-name
npm start
```

Notes on CSS modules and Flow can be found in [Week03](https://github.com/Kadee80/DynamicWeb23/tree/master/Week03#hello-typchecking-flow-eddition).

Together we will:

- Breifly discuss ternaries and conditional rendering inside our JSX.
- Create and import stylesheet containing our CSS variables for reusuable fonts/colors/sizing etc.
- Create a global stylesheet to handle resets and other project-wide styles.
- Import and use our CSS vars inside our CSS Module stylesheet.
- Take a moment for questions before switching gears.
- Install Flow and type check our data.

## OPTIONAL: Responsive Layouts and Media Queries

The third part of class today is optional. If you feel you would like to learn, or need a refresher in some responsive grid systems and menus please hang around. None of this section will be unique to React, just some good old fashioned CSS to style across multiple device sizes!

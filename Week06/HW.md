## HW Due Week07

Continue working on your "midterm" project. If you are using form elements aka inputs make sure you bind them to state the way we did in class today!

Week07 you will be presenting your projects. If you are working on a larger project which you would like to continue for your final, no worries! Just make sure you demo where you are at and what your next steps might be.
